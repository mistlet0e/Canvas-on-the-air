# Canvas-on-the-air - CoreXY pen plotter incorprated with OpenCV gesture recgonition
This project combines a CoreXY pen plotter with OpenCV gesture recognition. With this setup, you can draw pictures or write messages simply by making gestures with your hand!

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need the following components:

### CoreXY pen plotter
Computer with OpenCV installed
Webcam or other camera for gesture recognition
Once you have these components, you can follow these steps to set up the project:

### Clone this repository to your local machine.
1. Connect your CoreXY pen plotter to your computer via USB.
2. Install dependencies from the file 
3. Connect your webcam or other camera to your computer.
4. Run the gesture_recognition.py script to start the gesture recognition software.
